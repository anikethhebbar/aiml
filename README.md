# AI and ML Application Development Laboratory (18AIL76)

This repository contains programs and experiments for the AI and ML Application Development Laboratory course (18AIL76). Below are the details of each task and instructions on how to run the programs:

## Task 1: k-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm for Iris Classification

- **Program (Python)**: `p1.py`
- **Program (Jupyter Notebook)**: `p1.ipynb`
- **Description**: This program implements the k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the Iris dataset. It prints both correct and wrong predictions.
- **How to Run**: Execute the `p1.py` program using Python or open and run `p1.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook.

## Task 2: K-means and EM Clustering Comparison

- **Program (Python - K-means)**: `p2_kmeans.py`
- **Program (Jupyter Notebook - K-means)**: `p2_kmeans.ipynb`
- **Program (Python - EM)**: `p2_em.py`
- **Program (Jupyter Notebook - EM)**: `p2_em.ipynb`
- **Description**: These programs apply the K-means and Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms to cluster a dataset stored in a .CSV file. Compare the results of these two algorithms and comment on the quality of clustering.
- **How to Run**: Execute `p2_kmeans.py` and `p2_em.py` for K-means and EM clustering in Python, or open and run the corresponding Jupyter Notebook files.

## Task 3: Locally Weighted Regression

- **Program (Python)**: `p3.py`
